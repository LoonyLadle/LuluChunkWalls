# Lulu's Chunk Walls
Build natural stone walls and floors out of stone chunks.

## Gameplay Notes
Natural stone walls and floors can be built from stone *chunks* with stonecutting researched and a construction skill of 6.

## Technical Details
This mod uses a dynamic code patch to add buildable data to all natural walls which drop stone chunks when mined and the floors they leave behind. Because of this, Lulu's Chunk Walls should be compatible with any mods that add additional types of natural stone walls with mineable stone chunks.
