# Lulu's Chunk Walls
Build natural stone walls out of stone chunks.

## Gameplay Notes
Natural stone walls require stonecutting to be researched and a construction skill of 4. Additionally, note that natural stone walls leave a rough stone floor when destroyed; this can be used to create natural stone floors.

## Technical Details
This mod uses a patch to make stone chunks into their own type of stuff which is only used to build the stone chunk wall. The stone chunk wall itself never actually exists in the game; the moment it is spawned it is destroyed and replaced by a type of building that, when mined, drops the stuff that the chunk wall is made out of. Because of this, Lulu's Chunk Walls should be compatible with any mods that add additional types of mineable stone chunks.
