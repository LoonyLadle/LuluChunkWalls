# Lulu's Chunk Walls
Build natural stone walls out of stone chunks.

## Gameplay Notes
Natural stone walls require stonecutting to be researched and a construction skill of 6. Additionally, note that natural stone walls leave a rough stone floor when destroyed; this can be used to create natural stone floors.

## Technical Details
This mod uses a dynamic code patch to add buildable data to all natural walls which drop stone chunks when mined. Because of this, Lulu's Chunk Walls should be compatible with any mods that add additional types of mineable stone chunks.
